        <h5>Question 3‚ùì</h5>
        <p>How come you say STC30 can alleviate many diseases yet it's one?</p>
        <h5>AnswerüÖ∞Ô∏è</h5>
        <p>
          STC30 is neither a drug or a herb. It is designed as a Therapy which
          gives your own body the ability to heal itself naturally by making use
          of plant stem cells to boost your own human stem cells. Stem cells
          regenerate by splitting and making more of their kind to repair organs
          and replace dead or diseased cells. That is what STC30 does, the
          diseases that are then addressed are many because your body will
          determine where the stem cells need to go and replace any cells not
          functioning well. Most diseases are caused by cells misbehaving or not
          doing their job properly.

          <h2>What are stem cells</h2>

          <p>
            Stem cells are unspecialized cells of the human body. They are able
            to differentiate into any cell of the body and have the ability of
            self-renewal.
          </p>
          <p>
            When life begins, a single giant cell (the zygote) replicates
            repeatedly to give rise to every other cell in the body. The cell
            from which other cells spring forth contain the entire genetic code
            of the person (the genetic code is the biological software that
            produces and defines each cell type in the body). After the body has
            been developed, among the trillions of cells in the body remains a
            population of quiescent stem cells waiting to be called into action
            to help in the repairs of damaged tissue. These stem cells abound
            everywhere. They are present in the body’s adipose tissue, bone
            marrow, and in every single tissue compartment. The stem cells are
            nature’s repair kit. They wait readily to repair tissues whenever
            the need arises.
          </p>

          <p>
            The body has over 220 different cell types but the stem cells don't
            have any specific function and can become any of the spcialized
            cells in the body such as nerve cells, skin cells, muscle cells,
            hair cells, red blood cells, beta cells, cells of the heart, kidney,
            liver, bones, brain, muscle etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cells are the building blocks of our bodies, they form tissues,
            organs and then the body systems. With over 50 trillion cells in our
            bodies, cellular health is crucial to our health
          </p>

          <h2>How do stem cells work</h2>
          <p>
            How the adult stem cells work can be illustrated using the skin as
            an example. The skin is used because it is the ‘guidepost’ for how
            old a person is. As one gets older, the skin starts to thin and lose
            its elasticity. It is the loss of this elasticity that causes it to
            wrinkle and sag. Normally, the skin consistently renews itself,
            shedding old cells as new cells are created underneath. The birth of
            these new skin cells is caused by the activities of the adult stem
            cells. As one ages, the adult stem cells decrease in number and
            gradually become dysfunctional. If one is able to keep the
            regeneration of skin tissue at more youthful levels by the addition
            of adult stem cells, He/she would be able to maintain a
            youthful-looking skin for a longer period of time. Practical and
            experimental evidence exist to show that the repair of organs can be
            achieved with this technology. However, whether this same technology
            can be used to stop general aging is yet to be ascertained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stem cells have the ability to replicate more cells, replace damaged
            cells and feed other cells

          <h2>The STC30</h2>
          <p>
            STC30 is an acronym for Super Life Total Care 30 or Stem Cell 30
            days of transformation, meaning that one has 30 days to transform
            their lives using the stem cell. It is a plant-based stem cell, a
            product ahead of its time which uses stem cells to manage, prevent
            or address several health complications. It is the origin of stem
            cell treatment in curing and prevention of diseases
          </p>

          <p>
            The STC30 is manufactured by Mibelle Bio Chemistry in Zurich
            Switzerland Laboratory that is GMP certified for liquid supplements
            and a certified member of The Natural Products Association. The
            Laboratory meets National Science Certification which conforms with
            FDA mandated Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Guidelines for

          </p>

          <p>
            BILBERRY EXTRACT scientifically known as vaccimium myrtillus.
            BIlberry has a lot of functions, e.g; protects against liver damage,
            skin protection, diarrhea, wound healing, cardio-protective effects,
            reduction of bad cholesterol, helps against urinary tract infections
            and portects against eye disorders.
          </p>

          <p>
            GLISODIN (CANTALOUPE EXTRACT). Glisodin stimulates the body's
            antioxidant defence system. It enhances the body's producton of its
            own natural anti-oxidants. Because of this, the body is well
            equipped to recover, combat stress as well as prevent DNA damage
            induced by oxidative stress.
          </p>

          <p>
            BLACK CURRANT JUICE POWDER. Black currants are rich in anthocyanins,
            polyphenlic substances, antioxidants, viamic C and Gamma-Linolenic
            Acid. Black currants help in regulating blood flow, improvement of
            the immune system, ocular health, gut health and kidney health.
          </p>

          <p>
            PHYTOCELLTEC SOLAR VITIS (VITIS VINIFERA). These are extracts from
            grapes. Grapes have substantial anti-aging benefits in the peel and
            seed.
          </p>

          <p>
            PHYTOCELLTEC MALUS DOMESTICA (UTWILLER SPATLAUBER). Also known as
            the swiss apple found in the swiss alps, it is a liposomal
            prepartion of apple stem cells. This is different from other apples,
            it is sour in taste, it can renew its skin if cut and can stay upto
            six months still fresh. It has similarities to the human cells and
            has anti-aging properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this modern world, it is nearly impossible to stay away from
            disease. From the foods we eat, the electronics we use and their
            radiations, ultra-violet rays from the sun, the drugs we use for
            medicine, the chemicals we use in farming, food preparation and also
            apply in different activities, the pollution, the stress, etc. And
            you find that everyone is a candidate of getting sick at anytime.
            The STC30 slows the ageing process, detoxifies and rejuvenate the
            body, promote cell regeneration, strengthen the immune system, give
            a new lease of life, a new strength, a new vigor and address several
            health conditions even those formerly known as incurable. It is good
            for everyone to optimize their health whether sick or not and it is
            recommended that everyone takes atleast two boxes of the STC30 in
            their life time for their own health. The STC30 is proven to cure
            100% with no side effects unlike the conventional medicines which
            most of the time remove symptoms and not the root cause but the
            STC30 treats from the root cause, the cellular level.{" "}
          </p>

          <h2>The healing process of the STC30</h2>
          <p>
            STC30 goes through the nerves, travel to the brain and provide a
            signal where there is need to repair and regenerate cells. The time
            taken to see results varies from patient to patient. Some bodies
            respond faster to the therapy than others and the longer the patient
            has suffered from the disease the longer the time required to heal
            completely. The time for healing ranges from one to six months.
          </p>

          <h2>How to administer</h2>
          <p>
            Keep dosage to one sachet a day. If you have a severe condition you
            can increase to 2 sachets a day, taking one in the morning and one
            in the night. If you are pregnant or nursing, please talk tou your
            physician. Children can take the STC30 but with adult supervision.

          Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in adults and 5th
          among the causes of disease burden in developing countries. A stroke
          is a "brain attack". It can happen to anyone at anytime. It occurs
          when blood flow to an area of the brain is cut off. When this happens,
          the brain cells are deprived of oxygen and begin to die. When brain
          cells die, abilities controlled by that area of the brain such as
          memory and muscle control are lost.

          A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial.
          Early action can reduce brain damage and other complications.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are mainly two types of stroke, ie, Ischemic stroke which
          happens when a bood clot keeps blood from flowing to the brain and
          Hemorrhagic stroke which occurs when a blood vessel in your brain
          ruptures or breaks, spilling blood into the surrounding areas.

          Risk factors of stroke include lifestyle choices like overweight,
          physical inactivity, heavy drinking, smoking, use of illegal drugs
          such as cocaine and methamphetamine and medical factors like high
          blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea,
          heart diseases and disorders, family history of stroke, COVID-19.
          Other factors include age and hormones

          Stroke can lead to double vision, one sided paralysis, change in the
          level of consciousness or confusion, difficulty with balance, face
          dropping, difficulty speaking and swallowing, partial vision and
          convulsions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stroke can be prevented; By managing diabetes, keeping blood pressure
          under control, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, mantaining
          a healthy weight, avoiding alcohol and illegal drugs.

          Until recently, brain tissue damage was considered permanent but now
          with the stem cell treatment, there can be brain cell regrowth and
          improvement in the neurological function. The STC30 activates cells
          around the affected brain tissue to catalyze rapid healing and improve
          brain function. It also boosts, regenerate nerve cells around the
          affected areas which improves motor function. The STC30 manages and
          treats stroke 100%

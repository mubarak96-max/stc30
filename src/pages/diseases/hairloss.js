          The loss of hair from part of the head or body interferes with the
          many useful biological functions of the hair including sun protection
          and dispersal of sweat gland products.

          Each strand of hair is a complex weaving of lifeless protein produced
          by a teardrop-shaped hair follicle. Thr hair follicles are made of
          living cells that receive nourishment entirely from the blood supply
          under the skin. The hair itself is made up of completely dead cells.

        <p>There are various types of hairloss;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Involutional alopecia, a natural conditon in which the hair
            gradually thins with age. More hair follicles go into resting phase,
            and the remaining become shorter and few in number.
          </li>
          <li>
            Androgenic alopecia is a genetic condition that can affect both men
            and women. Men with this condition can begin suffering hair loss as
            early as their teens or early 20s. It is characterised by a receding
            hairline and gradual diasappearance of hair from the crown and
            frontal scalp. Women with this condition dont't experience
            noticeable thinning until their 40s or later.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Alopecia areata often starts suddenly and causes patchy hair loss in
            children and young adults. This condition may result in complete
            baldness. But in about 90% of people with the condition, the hair
            returns within a few years.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Alopecia universalis causes all body hair to fall out, including
            eyebrows, eyelashes and the pubic hair.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Trichotillomania, seen most frequently in children, is a
            psychological disorder in which a person pulls out one's own hair.
          </li>
          <li>
            Telogen effluvium is temporary hair thinning over the scalp that
            occurs because of changes in the growth cycle of hair.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scarring alopecias result in result in permanent loss of hair.
            Inflammatory skin conditions and disorders often result in scars
            that destroy the ability of the hair to regenerate. Hot combs and
            hair too tightly woven and pulled can also result in permanent hair
            loss

          The stem cell therapy is a process which has given proven results. It
          is an efficient, non-surgical therapy that stimulates and regrow hair
          follicles. Stem cells in the follicles ensure the continous supply of
          cells and helps multiplying hair cells on a fast pace. Thus the stem
          cells not only helps to fight the hair loss but also improves the
          texture and hair quality

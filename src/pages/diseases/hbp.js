        <p>
          Hypertension also known as high blood pressure is when the pressure of
          the blood being pumped through the arteries is higher than it should
          be. Each time the heart beats, blood is pumped through the arteries
          and veins. Arterial pressure is created by the force exerted by thr
          blood against the artery walls, as they carry blood around the body.
          Almost half of all adults in many parts of the world have high blood
          pressure, but many are not aware of this fact. Hyprtension is a silent
          killer because it often has no warnings and many people are not aware
          of it in them. And overtime the constant pressure overload causes
          accumulating damage tht eventually becomes more than the circulatory
          system can handle, often leading to serious health problems. You can
          have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms.

          Blood pressure is divided into four categories; Normal blood prssure
          which is below 120/80 mm Hg, Prehypertension - 120-139 / 80-89 mm Hg,
          Stage One Hypertension - 140-159 / 90-99 mm Hg, Stage Two Hypertension
          - 160 / 100 mm Hg or higher. Types of hypertension; primary,
          secondary, malignant, resistant, pulmonary and pseudo hypertension.

          Most people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms, even
          if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels but a few
          people with high blood pressure may have headaches, shortness of
          breath or nosebleeds, but these signs and symptoms aren't specific and
          usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or
          life-threatening stage. Long term hypertension can lead to heart
          failure and heart attacks, stroke, bleeding and blindness.

          Risk factors include; genetics, hormone problems, lupus, age,
          lifestyle choices, certain medicatins, kidney disorders and
          obstructive sleep apnoea.

          Hypertension can be prevented by mantaining a healthy weight,
          exercising regularly, reducing salt intake, alcohol moderation,
          managing stress, nutrients like pottasium, magnesium and calcium, fish
          oils, garlic.

          The STC30 has the ability to repair the cells responsible for the
          blood pressure, the endothelial cells and the muscle cells attached to
          the free blood pressure movement. It will also decrease blood lipid,
          blood viscousity, prevent platelet aggregation, prevent excessive
          blood clotting, reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, inhibit the
          thickening of arteries, dilate and relaxe arteries lower blood
          cholesterol level, prevent age-related muscular degeneration. It will
          stabilize the blood pressure from the root cause.

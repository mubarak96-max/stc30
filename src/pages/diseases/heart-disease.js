          Heart disease (cardiovascular diseases) are conditions that affect the
          structure and functions of the heart.
        </p>
        <p>Heart disease has different types;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Coronary artery heart disease that affects the arteries to the
            heart.
          </li>
          <li>
            Valvular heart disease that affects how the valves function to
            regulate blood flow in and out of the heart.
          </li>
          <li>Cardiomyopathy that affects how the heart muscle squeezes.</li>
          <li>
            Heart rhythm disturbances that affect the electrical conduction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heart infections where the heart has structural problems that
            develop before birth.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Heart disease causes depend on your specific type of heart disease.
          Some of the causes of heart disease include; Thickening of artery
          walls, high blood pressure, enlarging of the heart muscle, reduced
          blood flow to the heart, diabetes, smoking, bacteria, viruses and
          parasites, excessive use of alcohol or caffeine, drug abuse, stress,
          some medications, infections, age, chemotherapy, family history, poor
          diet, obesity, poor dental health, stress, connective tissue
          disorders, rheumatic fever, physical inactivity, poor hygiene.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you might not be diagnosed with heart disease until you have
          a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure so it's important to
          watch for cardiovascular symptoms. Heart disease symptoms depend on
          what type of heart disease you have and they may be different for men
          and women and they include; chest pain, tightness and pressure,
          shortness of breath, pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs
          or arms, pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back, racing
          heartbeat, slow heartbeat, lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, pale
          gray or blue skin color, swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around
          the eyes. Heart disease can lead to heart failure, heart attack,
          stroke, aneurysm, cardiac arrest.

          With the stem cell therapy (STC30) you can be totally treated of heart
          disease. With respect to the heart, stem cells have the ability to not
          only home into the damaged areas but also to initiate a cascade of
          biological events which both culminate in healing of the heart muscle.
          The stem cell will cause new muscle cells to be formed through
          stimulation of dormant stem cells that are already inside the heart
          muscle and also the administered stem cell will also transform into
          new heart muscle cells. Since the STC30 is immune system privileged,
          cell rejection is not an issue and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)
          matching is not necessary. Through administration of the stem cell
          therapy (STC30), there's improvements in heart disease patients.

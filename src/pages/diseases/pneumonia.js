        <p>
          Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both
          lungs. During infection, the alveoli of one or both lungs fill up with
          pus or fluid and it increases the work of breathing and thus gaseous
          exchange in the lungs can't occur at it normally would.
        </p>
        <p>
          The body has defense mechanisms against the agents of pneumonia ie,
          coughing, mucociliary escalator, macrophages. If these mechanisms fail
          and a microbe succeeds in colonizing the alveoli, they multiply and
          quickly move over in to the lung tissue activating an inflammatory
          response and the result is pneumonia.{" "}

          Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It
          is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age
          65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pneuonia can be caused by bacteria especially the streptococcus
          pneumoniae, fungi and viruses including COVID 19. People with a
          weakened immune system are at a high risk of acquiring pneumonia.
          Other risk factors include; age of 2 years and below and 65 years and
          above, smoking, flu, cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic
          bronchitis, asthma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Signs and symptoms; headache, vomiting, difficulty breathing,
          dehydration, fever, chills, coughing, muscle pains, malaise, loss of
          appetite, fluid accumulation around the lungs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pneumonia can be prevented by vaccination, maintaining a good hygiene,
          avoiding smoking and keeping the immune system strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          The STC30 manages and treats pneumonia. It strengthens the immune
          system, stimulate the macrophages and reduce lung inflammation and it
          can fully regenerate the respiratory system.

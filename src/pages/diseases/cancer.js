        <p>
          Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells which can spread
          to other parts of the body. Cancer develops when the body’s normal
          control mechanism stops working. Old cells do not die and instead grow
          out of control, forming new, abnormal cells. These extra cells may
          form a mass of tissue, called a tumor. Some cancers, such as leukemia,
          do not form tumors.

          Cancer may occur anywhere in the body. In women, breast cancer is one
          of the most common. In men, it’s prostate cancer. Lung cancer and
          colorectal cancer affect both men and women in high numbers and there
          are various categories of cancer; Bladder cancer, Breast cancer,
          Colorectal cancer, Esophageal cancer, Head and neck cancer, Leukemia,
          Liver cancer, Lung cancer, Ovarian cancer, Pancreatic cancer, Skin
          cancer, Stomach cancer, Uterine cancer and so many others

        <h5>Causes</h5>
        <p>
          Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to the DNA within cells. The
          DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes,
          each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what
          functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Errors in the
          instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and thus
          the cell becomes cancerous. Gene mutations can be born with and these
          account for a small percentage of the cancers while the rest occur
          after birth and these can be caused by factors like smoking radiation,
          hormonal changes, lack of physical exercises, viruses, obesity,
          chronic inflammations and cancer-causing chemicals. Other risk factors
          of cancer include age, habits and life style choices, environment,
          family history, health conditons.

          Cancer can cause several complications, including pain, fatigue,
          difficulty breathing, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, weight loss,
          brain and nervous system complications.

          There's no certain way to prevent cancer. But doctors have identified
          several ways of reducing your cancer risk, such as stopping smoking,
          avoiding excessive sun exposure, maintaining a healthy diet,
          moderating alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, having
          physical exercises, having regular cancer checkups and exercises.

          Cancer is known as a fatal disease because most of the time patients
          die. It is treated by; Surgery: directly removing the tumors,
          Chemotherapy: using chemicals to kill cancer cells, Radiation therapy:
          using X-rays to kill cancer cells and the bone marrow and stem cell
          transplant
        </p>

          The STC30 is a modern simplified treatment for cancer, it is based on
          the stem cell treatment. Cancer is caused by DNA mutation and
          multiplication of abnormal cells, the STC30 stimulates the body to
          produce more cells to replace the damaged ones, nourish the healthy
          cells and fight off the abnormal cells which in turn reduces them to
          zero. The STC30 can eradicate cancer of any type within 2-6 months
          depending on the level it is about.

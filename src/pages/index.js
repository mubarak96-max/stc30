            STC30 is an acronym for Super Life Total Care 30 , meaning that one
            has 30 days to transform their lives using the power of the STC30.
            It is a product ahead of its time which manages, prevents or address
            several health complications.

        <div className="desc">
          <p>
            These (stem) are unspecialized cells of the human body. They are
            able to differentiate into any cell of the body and have the ability
            of self-renewal.
          </p>
          <p>
            When life begins, a single giant cell (the zygote) replicates
            repeatedly to give rise to every other cell in the body. The cell
            from which other cells spring forth contain the entire genetic code
            of the person (the genetic code is the biological software that
            produces and defines each cell type in the body). After the body has
            been developed, among the trillions of cells in the body remains a
            population of quiescent primary cells waiting to be called into
            action to help in the repairs of damaged tissue. These cells abound
            everywhere. They are present in the body’s adipose tissue, bone
            marrow, and in every single tissue compartment. They are nature’s
            repair kit. They wait readily to repair tissues whenever the need
            arises.

            The body has over 220 different cell types but the primary cells
            don't have any specific function and can become any of the
            specialized cells in the body such as nerve cells, skin cells,
            muscle cells, hair cells, red blood cells, beta cells, cells of the
            heart, kidney, liver, bones, brain, muscle etc. Cells are the
            building blocks of our bodies, they form tissues, organs and then
            the body systems. With over 50 trillion cells in our bodies,
            cellular health is crucial to our health

        <h2>How does the STC30 work</h2>
        <div className="desc">
          <p>
            How these cells work can be illustrated using the skin as an
            example. The skin is used because it is the ‘guidepost’ for how old
            a person is. As one gets older, the skin starts to thin and lose its
            elasticity. It is the loss of this elasticity that causes it to
            wrinkle and sag. Normally, the skin consistently renews itself,
            shedding old cells as new cells are created underneath. The birth of
            these new skin cells is caused by the activities of the body's
            primary cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as one ages, these cells decrease in number and gradually become
            dysfunctional. If one is able to keep the regeneration of skin
            tissue at more youthful levels by the addition of the primary cells,
            He/she would be able to maintain a youthful-looking skin for a
            longer period of time. Practical and experimental evidence exist to
            show that the repair of organs can be achieved with this technology.
            However, whether this same technology can be used to stop general
            aging is yet to be ascertained. The STC30 have the ability to
            replicate more cells, replace damaged cells and feed other cells
          </p>
          <img src="/s.png" alt="how the stc30 work" />
          <p>
            When the STC30 goes into the body, it triggers production of more
            cells in the body. Then the body detects where there is need for
            them, where there is an abnormal health condition or disfunctioning
            of the cells and fix it while also rejuvenating and regenerating the
            tissues and organs involved hence facilitating healing.

        <h2>What is the function of the STC30</h2>
        <div className="desc">
          <p>
            First of all, the STC30 boosts your <strong>immune system</strong>.
            The immune system shields the body from diseases and disorders by
            creating a barrier that prevents body invaders or antigens from
            going into it and incase they slip and enter, the immune system
            produces white blood cells and other chemicals and proteins that
            attack and destroy substances foreign to the body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The STC30 <strong>detoxifies the body.</strong> It removes toxic
            substances from the body, flushing out bad blood, water and other
            substances leaving your body system clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            The STC30 <strong>rejuvenates the body.</strong> It gives you a new
            feel, a new strength and vigor restoring your youth and making you
            more energetic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The STC30 also{" "}
            <strong>
              nourishes and regenerates cells and repairs damaged ones.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The STC30 also
            <strong>
              regenerates and repair damaged body tissues and organs
            </strong>
            . Since cells are the building blocks of the body, they receive
            signals from the brain and go to damaged cells, tissues or organs
            and start rebuilding them.

          <p>
            STC30 goes through the nerves, travel to the brain and provide a
            signal where there is need to repair and regenerate cells. The time
            taken to see results varies from patient to patient. Some bodies
            respond faster to the therapy than others and the longer the patient
            has suffered from the disease the longer the time required to heal
            completely. The time for healing ranges from one dose (30 days) to
            six months (six doses). A dose of the STC30 is of 2 boxes, each box
            contains 15 sachets into which the STC30 is prepared in powder form.
